/**
 * Fires the GA4 conversion for a completed enquiry.
 *
 * Deliberately an event rather than a plain /thank-you/ pageview conversion.
 * A pageview counts every refresh, every back-button return and every time the
 * tab is restored, which inflates the number that matters most. This fires
 * `generate_lead` once and then writes a marker to sessionStorage, so a reload
 * of the same page does not count twice.
 *
 * sessionStorage is per-tab and cleared when the tab closes, which is the right
 * scope: a genuine second enquiry in a new session should count again.
 *
 * The event is pushed onto dataLayer whether or not gtag.js has finished
 * loading. On a hard load of this page the tag script and this effect race each
 * other, and simply checking for window.gtag would silently drop the conversion
 * whenever the effect won. gtag.js replays everything already queued on
 * dataLayer when it initialises, so queueing is safe and losing the race is not.
